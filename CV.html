                <p> Personal Profile <br> <br>
                    In addition to having good attention to detail and developed problem solving skills, I am also very creative which helps me deal with various challenging situations and problems in innovative and efficient ways. Furthermore, I am resilient, positive, and determined so even on the occasions that attempts at finding a solution fail, I will keep going until I succeed and complete the task or goal. <br>
