                    Personal Statement <br> <br>
                    I am a fourth year (starting in September 2023) student of Cyber Security and Forensics at Napier University. Throughout my studies, I have learned about the various elements that make up a secure network or system, from the common mistakes that an unknowing employee may make, to the intricate details of a single imperfection in a rule that may allow an attacker to wreak havoc on a system. My goal is to continue to expand my knowledge and skill set, while simultaneously contributing to the online safety of my environment. <br> <br>
                    I am comfortable using command line systems (Ubuntu and Cain, firewall configuration, etc) as well as graphic ones (Windows, MacOs, etc), and have had experience with both. During my Computer Architecture and Computer Networking modules, as well as the Comptia CyberSecurity+ course I have completed (I hope to take the exam before my next university semester in September) I learned how to fix various issues and carry out troubleshooting on various aspects of such systems. I know about the general process of how computer components work, as well as models such as the TCP/IP or OSI models. I am also capable of implementing this knowledge to effective troubleshooting, development, and other tasks. <br> <br>
                    With the right tools, I am able to carry out real time security analysis of a network. As part of my network security and cryptography and networked services modules, I have worked with Snort and used it to create an Intrusion Detection System. Snort, along with Wireshark, were used to analyse the operations of a botnet and create a set of rules that would detect the botnet on a network in my final project for the cryptography course. To use Wireshark effectively, I have knowledge of various ports, protocols, and TCP flags. I know how to follow data streams, and sometimes decrypt or decode the contents depending on the algorithms used. <br> <br>
                    When an incident is detected, I am able to continue the investigation in a manner accepted by courts, using tools such as Cain, which we explored during my digital forensicsâ€™ modules in both years at college. I know of the various requirements set out for organisations in such situations, such as those set out by GDPR. I am able to decide the correct course of action in incident detection and prevention, using the risk assessment matrix as well as taking into consideration the impact, against the cost of mitigating a vulnerability causing this risk. <br> <br>
                    In case a severe incident does occur, I have the knowledge of necessary incident mitigation methods (which must be taken prior to the incident), of disaster recovery and response guidelines, as well as the applicable laws and regulations regarding organisations who experience security incidents, or even data breaches. <br> <br>
                    I am capable of maintaining compliance to laws and regulations in the everyday functioning of an organisation, and, although it must be noted that I am not an official Cyber Essentials practitioner, in my second year at college I have completed a project in partnership with representatives from Cyber Essentials in which we learned about their requirements and rules, and then were to review an example application, highlighting any comments we would have made or actions we would have taken. This project gave me the knowledge necessary to put any organisation well on its way to becoming fully Cyber Essentials certified (which is a major sign of trustworthiness for partners, and mandatory if the organisation wants any government contracts) and compliant with many other regulations, guidelines, and rules.<br> <br>
                    In addition to my security background, I have experience with various programming languages. I have worked with Python to create various programs, not only fun little projects like a calculator of which car best suits my needs when I was searching for one, but also projects such as analysing a PCAP file with python. Furthermore, I am comfortable using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create interactive, and secure, websites (an example of this will be shown in my portfolio). I also have some experience with java, sql, regex, etc.<br> <br>
                    Most importantly, however, I am willing to learn. I am aware that no amount of previous knowledge or experience will prepare me for every task and situation I will find myself in, which is why I always strive to learn and improve further. I enjoy researching and finding information (which is why I also quite enjoy writing research papers, such as the one included in my portfolio) so in my free time, I intend to learn the basics of machine learning (which my Honours project will be based on) as well as some further tools I can use for my web development projects, such as Node.js. I would also like to attempt to get into the creation of mobile applications, although I have not yet taken many steps in this direction. <br> <br>
                    Overall, I believe I could bring benefit in various ways to the organisation, from troubleshooting of local problems or implementing vulnerability mitigation methods, to carrying out investigations from start to finish in a court recognised manner. I, personally, would also benefit greatly from an opportunity to put my skills and knowledge into practice to get further hands-on experience with such matters. <br> <br>
