                Well, I assume that this, the website you are now using, is the first project I should write about. This website will serve multiple purposes. First of all: <br>
                This website will provide users with various information about me <br>
                It will allow me to track my progress with various projects <br>
                etc, this is a test update to be honest so I will not go into too much detail. What I will say however, is where I currently am. <br>
                As of now, I have created the following pages: <br>
                Main Page: which is currently empty aside from the navigation bar <br>
                CV page: it contains the navigation bar (from now on, the title and navigation bar will be referred to as the basic structure) as well as most of my CV, accurate up to the date of this update. <br>
                Summary of Skills page: it contains the basic structure, as well as a few paraprahs about what I can do. This was supposed to be the main section of my professional background, however due to its length I decided it may be necessary to also add a CV page that conveys some of the same information in a much shorter manner <br>
                Projects Page: well, as of now it only has the basic structure. However, one click on ctrl-s, one refresh, and (hopefully...) that will change. So lets go.

              Alright, second update. I just realized I should probably start numbering them. So thats added. I also realized I should create a button that lets me add updates instead of having to edit the HTML, but yeah, thats a future plan. <br>
              As of now the update is as follows. The Project page has been succesfully updated, and I have improved my code a bit by removing redundancies. More specifically, I had a css file for each seperate page, which I have now replaced with a single file that contains the basics. If a specific page needs specific CSS, then it will recieve its own file with that CSS. <br>
